Prompt:
Illustration of the owl <does something>â€¦

The owl has bright blue glowing eyes that illuminate its warm, golden-brown fur. It wears a dark blue hoodie, simple in design, with its ears poking through. The underbelly and facial feathers are a lighter, honey-brown. Its feathers show a gradient from golden-brown to burnt orange. To keep the look natural and not AI-generated, we avoid overly precise details, focusing instead on the overall impression of warmth and simplicity, with the colors blending seamlessly.
Don't use words in the illustration, only numbers, symbols and graphs related to investments and cryptocurrencies.
